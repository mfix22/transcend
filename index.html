        <p class="sectionSerif"> Our core concept is to inspire the Madison student community to create businesses and innovative ideas that will change the world.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="sectionText"><b>Transcend</b>
          is a student organization focused on providing invaluable resources
          and opportunities to students on campus who are interested in
          creating their own ventures. We do not limit our memberâ€™s ideas to
          tech, mobile applications or purely entrepreneurial ventures;
          instead we encourage collaboration between majors and focuses which
          we hope inspires start up ideas that can change the world. Our
          utility comes from the vast network of alumni and professionals
          from the Madison area and beyond which we tap regularly for inspiring
          talks and informative workshops that our members can utilize to expand
          their knowledge beyond their curriculum and hopefully apply it towards
          innovation. Our impact goes beyond the resources we provide and the
          knowledge we impart to our members.
